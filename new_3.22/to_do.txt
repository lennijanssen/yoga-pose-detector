1. Create pose extraction tool from model explore notebook.
  This should be a callable function that takes an image and returns key points.
  The actual building of the df can be done within the notebook. This function
  can then be used within the actual app itself.

2. Create df out of all the images and train a NN model based on that df.
  This NN model should be able to predict the pose based on the KPs provided.

3. Build a streamlit front end.
